**`Ecology and Statistics`**

Hi! I’m a data scientist obsessed with patterns—both numerical and real-life. My career path has been a bit "off the beaten track": I’m autistic, hold a double degree in Statistics and Ecology, a master’s in Demography, a specialization in Data Science, and a Ph.D. in Climate Sciences. My brain loves connecting dots across disciplines (and hyper-focusing on random topics for hours—oops!).

At work, I’m knee-deep in data. I use Python and R to uncover hidden stories—from weather forecasts and biodiversity to agriculture and population studies. My neurodivergence gives me a unique eye for details and patterns, which comes in super handy for spotting insights others might miss.

**Outside work, you’ll find me:**
- 🎻 Playing violin (But only when my cats allow it);
- 🐱 Working overtime as a cat butler (they’ve trained me well);
- 🌱 Learning something new (lately: gardening and how not to kill cacti with overwatering).

I’m an eternally curious soul and see life through a distinctive lens (literally, in my case 😉). If you’d like to chat about:

- Data, climate, or nerdy projects;

- Neurodivergence in STEM/tech;

- Music, cats, or surviving the chaos of hyperfixations…

*Just reach out! (Fair warning: I might randomly drop facts about climate change or felines mid-conversation. 😸)*

P.S. "I once used statistics to calculate the probability of my cat knocking over my coffee… Spoiler: it’s alarmingly high."
